10 min Introduction: 
	- html/css = structure and content / style and presentation ; 
	- HyperText Markup Language
	- Chrome Developer Tools - go to any website and inspect its source code 
	- right click on page to see source on any web page

	- Not a programming language, but a mark up language
	- html structure of a page - <!Doctype>, <head>, <body>, 
	- conventions: < > < /> opening and closing, but some self closing tags
		- nesting

35 mins HTML
	- <title>
	- <!-- comment tags -->
	- heading tags <h1>
	- <p>aragraph tags
	- <br>eak tags
	- links <a>
	- images <img>

	- attributes: src, href, 

	- <div> tags, id and class - can refer to css styles
	segue to CSS

30 mins CSS
	- Cascading Style Sheets
	- can be in-line via style attribute (should be avoided)
	- also can be internal, in <head> using <style> tag (not as bad as in-line)
	- External - style.css file
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> inside <head>

	Selectors: Whereas HTML has tags, CSS has selectors
	- each selector has 'properties' inside { } 
	- a 'value' is given to the property following a colon; semi-colons seperate properties
	body {
    font-size: 14px;
    color: navy;
	}
	- ids and classes in HTML can be governed by .class-selector or #id-selector

	The Box Model: 
	- content area (e.g. an image), surrounding that you have the padding, surrounding that you have the border and surrounding that you have the margin.

	- Chrome Developer Tools: go to a site and play with CSS
